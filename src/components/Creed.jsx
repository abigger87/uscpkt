                of distinction in which I take just pride. I believe in the spirit of
                brotherhood for which it stands. I shall strive to attain its ideals, and
                by so doing to bring to it honor and credit. I shall be loyal to my college
                and my chapter and shall keep strong my ties to them that I may ever retain
                the spirit of youth. I shall be a good and loyal citizen. I shall try always
                to discharge the obligation to others which arises from the fact that I am a
                fraternity man.
