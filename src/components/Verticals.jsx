        <h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>

        <p>Everything's gotta start somewhere. With a team you come in with, or one you make while at HackSC, establish working relationships which will extend long past the weekend of April 12. Under 'Entrepreneurship,' we want to establish a space where you can create products, not just projects.</p>

        <h3>Entertainment</h3>

        <p>You're in LA, what did you expect? We're not looking for Ryan Gosling's replacement, his spot is full. However, there is plenty of room in regards to other tech developments across all fields: music,  gaming and interactive media, and naturally film and VFX.</p>

      <div className="column">
        <h3>Transportation</h3>

        <p>It's about time someone invented teleportation... or effective LA public transit. You decide. Mobility comes in many ways besides current public transit and ridesharing programs, and so it's up to you to take the initiative to develop new advances in transportation in an increasingly globalized world.</p>
